The SpriteKit Tutorial from Ray Wenderlich

I went through the tutorial from here: https://www.raywenderlich.com/71-spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners about how to create a simple game using SpriteKit. The game consists of a Ninja defending his side of the screen from oncoming zombies. The Ninja throws projectiles at the zombies to destroy them. If any zombie gets by the Ninja the game is lost. If you destroy 30 zombies you win.

This was a fun and enjoyable and well written tutorial.

Possible Improvements:
- Different types of zombies
- Keeping track of the score
- Something indicating the area you are defending
- Different weapons for the Ninja
- Different backgrounds
- Different levels
- An intro screen
- Difficulty selection
- Having zombies start by being closer vertically to you then have it become more random
- Have zombies take different paths
- Have different sized zombies
- Have zombies take different amount of hits
- A high score screne
- How do you test any of this?
